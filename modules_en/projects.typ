  title: [ENAC - PIR Drones],
  society: [Research exposure project (PIR)],
  location: [ ],
  date: [ongoing],
  description: list(
    [The research exposure project is an opportunity for ENAC students to understand how research work is done and to apply the skills they have acquired with greater autonomy.],
    [The aim of this project is to find the parameters that allow the behaviour of a swarm of drones to be adjusted in different scenarios such as navigation or obstacle and intruder avoidance. This research is carried out using genetic programming algorithms.],

  description: list(
    [This project is the conclusion of the control theory courses taken in the first semester of the year.],
    [We implemented a flight control law which manages the descent of an airliner, using different control paradigms: classical, modal and optimal.],
